        <h1 class="article__title">The GitHub Flow</h1>
       
        <p class="article__accent"> This guide explains how and why GitHub flow works.</p>
        <p class="article__content">GitHub flow is a lightweight, branch-based workflow that supports teams and projects where deployments are made regularly.</p>
        <p class="article__content">When you're working on a project, you're going to have a bunch of different features or ideas in progress at any given
        time â€“ some of which are ready to go, and others which are not. <span class="article__accent-secondary">Branching</span> exists to help you manage this workflow.
        When you create a branch in your project, you're creating an environment where you can try out new ideas.</p>
        <p class="article__content">Once your branch has been created, it's time to start making changes. Whenever you add, edit, or delete a file, you're <span class="article__accent-secondary">making a commit</span>, and adding them to your branch. This process of adding commits keeps track of your progress as you work
        on a feature branch.</p>
        <p class="article__content">The next step is opening a <a href="./pull.html" class="article__link">pull request</a> . Pull Requests initiate discussion about your commits. Because they're tightly integrated with the underlying Git
        repository, anyone can see exactly what changes would be merged if they accept your request.</p>
        <p class="article__content">Once a Pull Request has been opened, the person or team <span class="article__accent-secondary">reviewing</span> your changes may have questions or comments. Perhaps
        the coding style doesn't match project guidelines, the change is missing unit tests, or maybe everything looks great and
        props are in order. Pull Requests are designed to encourage and capture this type of conversation.</p>
        <p class="article__content">Once your pull request has been reviewed and the branch passes your tests, you can <span class="article__accent-secondary">deploy</span> your changes to verify them in
        production. If your branch causes issues, you can roll it back by deploying the existing main branch into production.
        Different teams may have different deployment strategies. For some, it may be best to deploy to a specially provisioned
        testing environment. For others, deploying directly to production may be the better choice based on the other elements
        in their workflow.</p>
        <p class="article__content"> Now that your changes have been verified in production, it is time to <a href="./merge.html" class="article__link">merge</a> your code into the main branch. Once merged, Pull Requests preserve a record of the historical changes to your code. Because they're searchable, they let anyone go back in time to understand why and how a decision was made.</p>
