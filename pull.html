            <h1 class="article__title">Making pull requests</h1>
            <p class="article__accent">Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch.</p>
            <p class="article__content">After initializing a pull request, you'll see a review page that shows a high-level overview of the changes between your branch (the compare branch) and the repository's base branch. You can add a summary of the proposed changes, review the changes made by commits, add labels, milestones, and assignees, and @mention individual contributors or teams.</p>
            <p class="article__content">Once you've created a pull request, you can push commits from your topic branch to add them to your existing pull request. These commits will appear in chronological order within your pull request and the changes will be visible in the "Files changed" tab.</p>
            <p class="article__content">Other contributors can review your proposed changes, add review comments, contribute to the pull request discussion, and even add commits to the pull request.</p>
            <p class="article__content">After you're happy with the proposed changes, you can <span class="article__accent-secondary">merge the pull request</span>. If you're working in a shared repository model, you create a pull request and you, or someone else, will merge your changes from your feature branch into the base branch you specify in your pull request. For more information, see "Merging a pull request."</p>
        <p class="article__content">If status checks are required for a repository, the required status checks must pass before you can merge your branch into the protected branch.</p>
        <p class="article__content">You can link a pull request to an issue to show that a fix is in progress and to automatically close the issue when someone merges the pull request.</p>
        
        <h2 class="article__title-secondary">ProTip</h2>
        <p class="article__content">Pull Requests are useful for contributing to open source projects and for managing changes to shared repositories.</p> 
        <p class="article__content">If you're using a Fork & Pull Model, Pull Requests provide a way to notify project maintainers about the changes you'd like them to consider. If you're using a Shared Repository Model, Pull Requests help start code review and conversation about proposed changes before they're merged into the main branch.</p>
